*For those that really want to know what all mods updated, let me know. I'll talk to the Gremlins... they get hungry sometimes.

**Update Notes for Single player: 
Some of the configs/scripts are world related. So if you wish to keep your current SP world, but get the new settings.(Make a world backup first) All you need to do is Open the packs folder > copy all the files from the Defaultconfigs folder > then replace the saves/yourworld/serverconfigs with those files. [This does not affect the beta test server, as the Gremlins handle that]

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Server update:
Pretty much the same as the pack update, few differences
- Working on fixing some of the missing blocks on bluemap, expect map to be down or regerating at some point 
- Germlins handled the serverconfigs changes
